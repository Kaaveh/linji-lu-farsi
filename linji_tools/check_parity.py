"""Catch dropped paragraphs by comparing block counts between source/ and fa/.

A translator skipping a paragraph is the single most expensive error in this
kind of project: it is invisible in review, because the Persian reads perfectly
well without it, and it surfaces years later when someone compares editions.
Counting blocks catches it mechanically.

Blocks are blank-line-delimited runs, with fenced code held together -- what a
reviewer would call a paragraph, not what CommonMark calls a block. See
tools/_md.py. That is enough here because the comparison is like against like.

Files are paired by filename, which must match byte-for-byte across the two
trees. tools/make_stubs.py is what guarantees that; do not create fa/ files by
hand.

Skipped:
  * any fa/ file still marked `status: untranslated`
  * any fa/ file containing <!-- parity: skip -->

For deliberate structural divergence, prefer an offset over a skip -- it keeps
the file checked instead of switching it off:

    <!-- parity: offset -1 -->     fa/ has one block fewer than source/

The four part-opening chapters use this. Their part heading lives in
_quarto.yml as a `part:` entry so Quarto renders a real part title page, which
means the heading is not repeated in the Markdown.

If source/ is absent this exits 0 with a notice. That is the normal state in
CI, where the source text is deliberately not present -- it is licensed to the
maintainer for translation, not for redistribution.

Usage:
    tools/check_parity.py --check
