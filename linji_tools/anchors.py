"""Carry inline markup across a machine translator, and verify it survived.

Machine translation does not mangle inline markup -- measured, it *deletes* it,
every token, silently, leaving prose that reads perfectly well with no trace
that a note was ever there. Restoring by position afterwards is impossible
because markers sit mid-sentence, not at paragraph ends.

What the model does preserve is bracketed numeric sentinels, in place, including
mid-sentence. Measured across six bracket styles: twelve sentinels in, twelve
out, all positioned correctly. So:

    strip   source.md                 > draft.en.md
    <translator on draft.en.md>       > draft.fa.md
    restore source.md draft.fa.md     > out.md

`strip` replaces every token with U+27E6..U+27E7 sentinels. `restore` puts the
tokens back where the model left the sentinels -- if the model moved a sentence,
its marker moves with it, which is what you want. Token text is re-emitted from
the source, never from the translation, so ids cannot drift.

Nothing here knows what a token looks like. Callers supply a compiled pattern
and a render function, which between them are the only markup-aware parts:

    strip(text, token_re, render)
    restore(name, source_text, draft, token_re, render)

`render(match)` returns the form the token should take in the translation, or
None to drop it. See the calling project's adapter for a worked example.

When the model drops one anyway, `restore` refuses and quotes the source line
that sentinel sat in, so the caller can put it back in the draft and run again
rather than diff two whole files to find where it belonged.
